Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

CODE:

        n = len(nums)

        total = n*((n+1)/2)
        sum1 = 0
        missing = 0
        for i in range(n):
            sum1 = sum1 + nums[i]

        missing = total - sum1
        return int(missing)
